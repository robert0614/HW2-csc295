-Solution Approach:
The problem at hand requires finding a single unique element in a sorted array where every other element appears exactly twice and next to each other. The goal is to achieve this in O(log n) time complexity, indicating the need for a binary search approach.

-Binary Search Logic:
The primary observation is that pairs of elements, when correctly placed, will start at even indices and end at odd indices. When a unique element disrupts this pattern, it provides a clue to its position. The key steps in the binary search approach are:
1.	Calculate the mid-point of the current search space.
2.	Adjust the mid-point to ensure it is even, simplifying the check for pairs.
3.	Check if the element at the mid-point and the next element forms a pair:
•	If they do, the unique element must be in the right half.
•	Else, the unique element must be in the left half.
4.	Continue this process until the search space reaches a single element.

-Challenges and Solutions:
1.	Understanding the Pattern Disruption:
•	Initially, understanding how the presence of the unique element disrupts the pairing pattern required careful consideration. The insight that pairs will always start at even indices until disrupted by the unique element was crucial. By focusing on whether the mid-point element forms a pair with its adjacent element, we could determine which half of the array to discard.
2.	Index Adjustments:
•	Ensuring the mid-point was always even was a minor but critical adjustment. This adjustment allowed for basic logic when checking pairs and prevented off-by-one errors. Handling this with a simple if (mid % 2 == 1) mid--; ensured consistency.
3.	Edge Cases:
•	Addressing edge cases, such as the unique element being at the start or end of the array, required thorough testing. The binary search logic naturally handled these cases by continuously narrowing the search space until only the unique element remained.

-Conclusion:
This approach efficiently leverages binary search to solve the problem within the desired O(log n) time complexity. The key to success was recognizing the pattern in the array and how the unique element disrupts it, then using this insight to guide the binary search process. The C# implementation, with its clear structure and well-commented code, demonstrates a great solution to the problem. The challenges faced were addressed through careful analysis and logical adjustments, ensuring the solution was both correct and efficient.
